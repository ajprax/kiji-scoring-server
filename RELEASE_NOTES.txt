                              Kiji Scoring Server Release Notes

Version 0.16.0
  * SCORSRVR-30. ScoringServer now uses a default port of 7080 instead of 8080.  This will keep the
      default configuration from conflicting with KijiREST.

Version 0.11.0
  * SCORSRVR-5. ScoringServer interaction points have changed to include several commands under
      {BASE_URL}/admin including /admin/list /admin/get /admin/ping /admin/scan more information can
      be found in the JavaDoc for org.kiji.scoring.server.servlets.
      Model endpoints in the ScoringServer have moved to {BASE_URL}/models/endpoint.

Version 0.9.0
  * Initial re-commit of the scoring server in a separate project. Please see release notes
    under the kiji-model-repository for more information about release notes prior to this version.
